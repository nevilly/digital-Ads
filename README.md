   - An invoice should be generated with details of booked ads, total cost, and payment options.                   ✔️✔️

4. Technical Documentation

   - Provide a breakdown of the technology stack (frontend, backend, database, hosting).                             ✔️✔️ 

   - Define API integrations (if needed for payments or other functionalities).
   
   - Security measures for handling user data.
