# digital-Ads Website

## Here’s a overview of what I accomplished:

1. User Interface & Navigation

   - simple platform, intuitive, and easy to navigate.       ✔️✔️
   - search and filter ad slots, position, size, and price.  ✔️✔️
   - Avoid directly copying example—creativity is encouraged.✔️✔️

2. Ad Booking System

   -  to select the number of ads they want to book.         ✔️✔️
   - The system must calculate the total cost in real time.  ✔️✔️

3. Checkout & Invoice Generation

   - Once ads are selected, users should be able to proceed to a checkout screen. ✔️✔️
   - An invoice should be generated with details of booked ads, total cost, and payment options.                   ✔️✔️

4. Technical Documentation

   - Provide a breakdown of the technology stack (frontend, backend, database, hosting).                             ✔️✔️
